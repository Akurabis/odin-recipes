    <h3>This one-pot meal is nice.</h3>
    <p>Fermented sausage stays together, even when removed from its casing.</p>
    <p>When added to rice with peppers, you get a delightful meal that pays off a little effort big-time in flavour-variety and mouth-feel.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsn olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>150g fermented sausage</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes or 1 can of whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 large peppers of any variety</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>paprika, garlic, parsley and salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions and heat the oil. Add salt and garlic. When the oil starts to sizzle, add the onions. Let them sizzle, stirring occasionally until they become slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Remove the sausages from their casings, and slice them into rounds. Add them to the onions and let them sizzle.</li>
        <li>Chop the tomatoes and add them to the pot. If using canned tomatoes, make sure you break them up with your mixing spoon.</li>
        <li>Crudely chop the peppers and add them to the pot. Reduce the heat and cover.</li>
        <li>After some minutes, the pot should be simmering nicely. Add about one cup of water, and let simmer some more. Once it looks good, add the rice, paprika and parsely. Re-cover and let simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Give the pot a stir, re-cover and turn the heat OFF. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
