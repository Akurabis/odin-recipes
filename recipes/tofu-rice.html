    <h3>This skillet dish is quite delish.</h3>
    <p>Who says tofu isn't tasty?</p>
    <p>A distinctive blend of sesame oil, rice-wine vinegar, chilli-flakes, and soy-sauce give this dish a deep colour and flavour.</p>
    <p>It's very important to use leftover, or day-old rice for this dish. Freshly-cooked rice (saturated with moisture) will not absorb the flavour correctly, and does not fry correctly.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice-wine vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cups of leftover, or day-old, cooked rice</li>
        <li>300g firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped mushrooms</li>
        <li>50g green onions, for colour</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>garlic, flaked chilli (or chilli sauce), and soy sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the tofu into small cubes or smallish rectangular slabs. I prefer the slabs to increase 'sizzle-surface area'.
        <li>Chop the onion and heat the oil. Add rice-wine vinegar, soy sauce, chilli flakes (or chilli-sauce), and garlic. This should quickly mix together to create a rich sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the tofu. Sprinkle the onion on top. Let the tofu sizzle before stirring. Try to get an even brown across every piece of tofu.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms, which will re-hydrate the (by now) rapidly drying-our sauce. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the rice in stages, and stir well to avoid clumping. You want to try and coat every grain with oil.</li>
        <li>Add chopped green onions to add colour, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
